##  Identify Fraud from Enron Email


**Q1. Summarize for us the goal of this project and how machine learning is useful in trying to accomplish it. As part of your answer, give some background on the dataset and how it can be used to answer the project question. Were there any outliers in the data when you got it, and how did you handle those?**

**Ans.** Enron corporation was an American energy, commodities and services company based in Houstan, Texas. It was founded in 1985 as an merger between Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth, both relatively small regional companies. Enron employed approximately 20,000 staff and was a major electricity, natural gas, communications and plup and paper company. By 2000, Enron with claimed revenues of nearly $101 billion was one of the largest companies in the united states but by the end of 2002, it collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting federal investigation process, confidential information like financials of the company and emails exchanged between the employees got leaked into the public domain. So, the main goal of this project is to find persons of intrest who were responsible for Enron fraud by applying various machine learning algorithms.
